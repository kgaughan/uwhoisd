Planned:

 * Rate limiting.
 * Whitelists and blacklists.
 * Thread/process pool for the scraper. Currently, it's really, really slow.
 * Add a scraper mode where it just looks for *new* TLDs rather than spidering
   everything. 90% of the time, this is exactly what we want. Will require the
   config file be read, but that's OK.

Non-planned:

 * WHOWAS: this should be a separate service, really.
