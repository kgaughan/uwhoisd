General thanks:

 * Grigouze <https://github.com/grigouze> who pointed out that .name ought
   to use a more conservative method of zone discovery. I didn't use the
   patch provided, but it did give me the idea for the approach I did end
   up taking in the end, which also happened to simplify the handling of a
   number of other zones too, notably .bz.
